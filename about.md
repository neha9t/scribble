Hello, I am Neha - music lover, developer in process, devops in random state and automation engineer by profession. In my past time I sing, read, write & love to lend my listening ear.
Meeting people to catch on their infective smile is something I would never miss.

Exploring world, exploring to be silent and calm will be my forever quest. You can check out my songs [here](soundcloud.com/neha-tandon-1) 

This blog was developed with an intention to keep a track of my learnings and capture the randomness of moments experienced by me.

Have a nice day. â™¥
